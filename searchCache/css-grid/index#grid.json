{"title":"Grid","content":"<PackageInfo packageSlug=\"css-grid\" />\nThis package enables the rapid development of fully responsive layouts. With the grid, elements start and stop at consistent points across the horizontal plane and respond based on screen size. This ensures proper alignment and spacing across your entire app. The grid is a lightweight, component-centric wrapper around CSS Grid Layout â€” so props mirror this API very closely.\nA powerful feature of the grid are its breakpoints &mdash; where grid settings change across devices sizes. For example, a 14 column desktop grid with a 10px gutter could change to 8 column grid with a 5px gutter on mobile. Cells will span a different number of these columns as breakpoints are met based on their own props."}
