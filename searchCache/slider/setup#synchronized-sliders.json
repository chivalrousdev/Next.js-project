{"title":"Slider Setup - Synchronized sliders","content":"It is also possible to synchronize multiple sliders, so the navigation of one slider triggers another. To do this, lift the index of one slider using the onSlide prop. This is a callback function that will fire on every slide change with the current slide index. Then, use this value to control another slider with its currentSlideIndex prop.\nFor examples of synchronous sliders, check out lightbox slider or thumbnail slider."}
