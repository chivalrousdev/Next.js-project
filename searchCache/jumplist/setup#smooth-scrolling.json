{"title":"Jumplist Setup - Smooth-scrolling","content":"This package does not perform any smooth-scrolling of its own, and instead relies on native CSS scroll-behavior property. Set this property on the root html element of your document.\nOr use the smoothScroll prop on the provider, which sets this property as inline CSS.\nThere may also be cases where you want to temporarily disable smooth-scrolling, like between page transitions. To do this, you will need to add and remove this property dynamically using your app\\'s existing router."}
