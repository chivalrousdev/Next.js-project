{"title":"Getting started - Styling","content":"Faceless UI components have no appearance and apply as little CSS as possible to achieve core functionality. Every component exposes its DOM entirely, letting you control the markup to meet your exact needs. To customize the appearance of Faceless UI components, use your existing CSS setup by passing class names or style objects through props as you normally would. This makes it possible to tie into any CSS framework, such as CSS Modules."}
