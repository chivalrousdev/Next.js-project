{"title":"Collapsibles - How it works","content":"The <Collapsible> component does not render anything in the DOM, but controls the state of any nested <CollapsibleContent â€” an element whose height is animated from 0 to the auto-height using React Animate Height. This makes it possible to animate arbitrary content heights, a limitation of CSS alone.\nTo toggle the state of a collapsible there is a <CollapsibleToggler> component. This is a thin wrapper around the useCollapsible hook, firing the open method on click. This event propagates through the context to open or close the <CollapsibleContent>.\nAccordions are created by wrapping multiple <Collapsible> components with a single <CollapsibleGroup>. Collapsibles that are rendered inside a group are partially controlled by that group. When allowMultiple is set to false on the group, all collapsibles will close except the open that was opened.\nTransition times and curves are also easily customized using props. See the API for full details."}
