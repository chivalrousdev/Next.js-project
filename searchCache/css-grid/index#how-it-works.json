{"title":"Grid - How it works","content":"<Grid> and <Cell>components are used as often as necessary to achieve your desired layout. The <Grid> component has no required props and is only used to provide context to cells. Each <Cell> is controlled using props like col and start to determine how many columns the cell will span and which column to begin on. As the grid breaks down on smaller screens there is an additional prop for each breakpoint, like colsM and startM. See the API for full details.\nAt the top-level of your app is the <GridProvider>. This is where you define your global grid settings, such as breakpoints and gutters. Behind the scenes, it generates a tiny stylesheet containing classes for every grid and cell combination based on your particular configuration. These classes are dynamically injected into every <Cell> component, based on its props. This provides size and position to the cell as conditions are met."}
