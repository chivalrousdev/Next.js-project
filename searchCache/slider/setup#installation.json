{"title":"Slider Setup - Installation","content":"<InstallationCode name=\"slider\" />\nTo create a slider, wrap any portion of your app with the <SliderProvider>. This component does not render anything in the DOM and is where the slider settings are defined. Inside of this, render a <SliderTrack>. This will add a scrollable element onto the page which overflows its content as necessary. Then, nest as many <Slide> components within the track as necessary.\nPro tip: These components do not need to be direct descendants of one another."}
