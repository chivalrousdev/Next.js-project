{"title":"Modal API - Modal","content":"Each modal is portaled into the <ModalContainer>  and receives transition classes when opened or closed. The only required prop is a unique slug.\nYou can also pass a function as a child to conveniently access modal context. You could access the same context with the useModal hook, but this would require a child component, see the official Rules of Hooks."}
