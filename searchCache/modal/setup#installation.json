{"title":"Modal Setup - Installation","content":"<InstallationCode name=\"modal\" />\nFirst, wrap your app with the provider. This component does not render anything and should be nearest to the top of your app as possible. This is where the global settings are defined.\nAnywhere inside of this, render the <ModalContainer>. This is where each modal will portal into so its best to keep this relatively high in your tree.\nNow to create a modal, render a <Modal> component anywhere in your app. The only required prop is the unique slug that identifies this modal. The simplest way to open and close the modal is to use the <ModalToggler> component. This component takes the slug of any modal and toggles it open or closed based on the current state of that modal.\nAlternatively, you could build your own button. To do this, the toggle method can be directly accessed from the modal context with the useModal hook."}
