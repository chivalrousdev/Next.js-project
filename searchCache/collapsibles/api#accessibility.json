{"title":"Collapsibles API - Accessibility","content":"This package strictly follows the WAI-ARIA pattern for accordions:\n- <CollapsibleContent> has the following properties:\n  - role is region\n  - aria-labelledby is equal to the ID of the <CollapsibleToggler>\n- <CollapsibleToggler> is a <button> element with the following properties:\n  - type is button\n  - aria-expanded is toggled true or false based on isOpen\n  - aria-owns is equal to the ID of the <CollapsibleContent>\n  - aria-label is \"toggle collapsible\" by default\nNOTE: To match ARIA attributes between DOM elements, a unique ID is generated using nanoid. To opt out of this, just pass your own id to the <Collapsible> and it will be used instead.\n</JumplistNode>\n<JumplistNode nodeID=\"typescript\">"}
