{"title":"Jumplist Setup - Navigation","content":"To navigate jumplist nodes we rely entirely on native HTML behavior. By adding a hash to the URL that matches the id of an element in the document, the browser will automatically scroll to that element. You can also enable smooth scrolling.\nAlternatively, you can navigate jumplist nodes directly using the scrollToID method. This does not inject a hash into the URL, but instead relies on the native browser scrollIntoView API."}
