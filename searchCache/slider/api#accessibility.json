{"title":"Slider API - Accessibility","content":"This package strictly follows the WAI-ARIA pattern for carousels:\n- <Slide> has the following properties:\n  - role is group\n  - aria-roledescription is slide\n  - aria-label is CURRENT_INDEX of TOTAL_SLIDES\n- <SliderTrack> has the following properties:\n  - aria-live is either polite or off based on autoPlay\n- <SliderButton> is a <button> element with the following properties:\n  - aria-label is either Go to previous slide, Go to next slide, or Go to slide SLIDE_INDEX\n  - aria-controls is SLIDER_ID\n- <DotNav> renders <button> elements with the following properties:\n  - aria-label is either Go to slide SLIDE_INDEX\n  - aria-controls is SLIDER_ID\nYou should also add the following to your own markup on the top-level element that contains the slider components. This is because this part of the DOM is out of the scope of this module:\n  - aria-roledescription should be carousel\n  - aria-label should be an accessible name not including the keyword carousel\nNOTE: To match ARIA attributes between DOM elements, a unique ID is generated using nanoid. To opt out of this, just pass your own id to the <SliderProvider> and it will be used instead.\n</JumplistNode>\n<JumplistNode nodeID=\"typescript\">"}
