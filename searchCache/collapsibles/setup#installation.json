{"title":"Collapsibles Setup - Installation","content":"<InstallationCode name=\"collapsibles\" />\nTo create a new collapsible, wrap any section of your app with a <Collapsible> component. This does not render anything to the DOM and provides context for the other components to work together. Then render a <CollapsibleContent> component anywhere within this to have its height animated from 0 to auto on toggle. The easiest way to toggle a collapsible is with the <CollapsibleToggler> component.\nPro tip: set the openOnInit prop to have the collapsible open on first render."}
