{"title":"Jumplist Setup - Installation","content":"<InstallationCode name=\"jumplist\" />\nTo track elements as they enter and exit the viewport, you first need to wrap your app with the <JumplistProvider>. This does not render anything in the DOM and is where the global settings are defined. This will maintain the state of every jumplist node in your app and provide this state through context.\nThen, use a <JumplistNode> for every element you want to track. The only required prop of this component is the nodeID, a unique string identifying each node.\nEvery node is a wrapper around the Intersection Observer API, reporting its isIntersecting status to the jumplist context. You can access this from anywhere with the useJumplist hook.\nYou could also pass a function as a child to the <JumplistNode> to immediately return the context of that node."}
