      <p>
        Grids can be nested, so that alignment is maintained all the way through your DOM tree. Grids also support multiple breakpoints &mdash; so your grid can vary based on screen size. For example, a 14 column desktop grid with a 10px gutter could change to 8 column, 5px gutter on mobile. Cells will span a different number of these columns as breakpoints are met, based on their props.
