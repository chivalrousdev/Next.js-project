{"title":"Scroll Info","content":"<PackageInfo packageSlug=\"scroll-info\" />\nThis is a utility to efficiently subscribe to window scroll events. As components in your application interact with scroll position, they compound scroll listeners which can be expensive to handle. To get around this, the useScrollInfo hook reads context from the <ScrollInfoProvider> â€” which attaches only a single event listener to the window. These events are also piped through requestAnimationFrame so they are already optimized for performance.\nThis utility also conveniently interprets scroll data for you, such as direction of scroll, scroll percentage, etc."}
