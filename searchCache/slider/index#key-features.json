{"title":"Slider - Key features","content":"- Scrollable\n  One big UX challenge with sliders is that they are often painful to navigate. Natural scroll behavior is either removed are hijacked.\n- Snap-scrolling\n- Drag-scrolling\n- Auto-playing\n- Synchronized sliders\n- Anchor handling\n  A common pain point of sliders is that while you slide, nested anchor links are clicked. To prevent this, we recursively disable pointer events on all anchor links while the user is dragging using CSS pointer-events.\n- Scrollbar component\n  Another common pain point of sliders are that the scrollbar is bound to the overflowing element. To fix this, the current progress of any slider can be displayed using the <SliderProgress> component â€” a powerful alternative to native scrollbars. This allows you to render a draggable scrollbar anywhere in your DOM, even outside of your track."}
