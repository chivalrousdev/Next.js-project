To customize the appearance of Faceless UI components, use your existing CSS setup. Every Faceless UI component exposes its DOM entirely, letting you customize the markup to meet your exact needs. A typical pattern is to pass class names or style objects to these components through props. This makes it possible to tie into any CSS framework, such as CSS Modules."}
